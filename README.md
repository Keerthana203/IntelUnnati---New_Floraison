## Accident Locations on Indian Roads 

This project analyzes accident locations across India using data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) and visualizes the spatial distribution of accident-prone areas (blackspots) using QGIS software. The goal is to identify high-risk areas and provide insights that can aid in improving road safety.

*Project Overview:*

This project utilizes Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to map accident blackspots and perform spatial analysis. By pinpointing these areas, targeted interventions can be recommended to reduce accidents and enhance road safety across India. The most recent accident data up to 2021 has been used.

*Key Objectives:*
+ Analyze spatial patterns of accidents in India.
+ Identify accident-prone locations (blackspots).
+ Provide actionable insights to improve road safety.

*Tools & Technologies Used*
+ QGIS Software: Used for visualizing and analyzing accident locations.
+ GIS Tools: For spatial analysis and hotspot identification.
+ MoRTH Data: Ministry of Road Transport and Highways accident statistics (2021).
+ PowerBi: For visualization of data and gaining insights.

*Project Outcomes*
+ Identification of accident-prone blackspots across Indian roads.
+ Recommendations to reduce fatalities and injuries through better infrastructure, law enforcement, and traffic management.
+ Enhanced emergency response strategies based on accident hotspot analysis.

*Key Features*
+ Data Visualization: Visual maps highlighting accident-prone areas using QGIS.
+ Hotspot Analysis: Identification of areas with high accident concentration.
+ Recommendations: Actionable insights for improving road safety.

*Achievements*

This project won the Runner-up position in a competitive academic program, recognizing its contribution to improving road safety using data-driven methods.

*Installation*
+ Download and install QGIS.
+ Import the accident data from the MoRTH database.
+ Use the provided GIS layers and scripts to visualize and analyze the accident locations.

*How to Use*
